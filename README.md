## Description

This repository contains an example Python API that is vulnerable to several different web API attacks.

## Installation

We will be using docker images and containers to install all the api. 

### MacOSX

* Download [docker toolbox](https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases/download/v1.10.1/DockerToolbox-1.10.1.pkg)
* Go through installation steps
* Start up Kitematic ![kitematic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimtruck/vulnerable-api/master/kitematic.png).
* In the search box type `mkam/vulnerable-api-demo` and click create ![create](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimtruck/vulnerable-api/master/create.png).
* On right side you will see an IP:PORT access url ![ip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimtruck/vulnerable-api/master/ip.png).
* Copy it and paste into browser to navigate to the api (The error message is what you're supposed to see) ![browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dimtruck/vulnerable-api/master/browser.png).

#### Install Burp Proxy

* Install java [from oracle website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) if you don't have it already
* Download jar file from [burp website](https://portswigger.net/burp/downloadfree.html)
* Run java -jar burpsuite_free_v1.6.32.jar

### Windows

## API Details

The example API can be accessed on the system at port 8081.

### What is vAPI

vAPI is an API written specifically to illustrate common API vulnerabilities.

vAPI is implemented using the Bottle Python Framework and consists of a user database and a token database.

### How is vAPI Used

#### vAPI Process flow

1. Request token from /tokens
  * Returns an auth token
  * Returns expiration date of auth token
  * Returns a user id
2. Request user record from /user/<user_id>
  * Requires the auth token
  * Returns the user record for the user specfied, provided the auth token is not expired and is valid for the user id specified
  * Each user can only access their own record

#### Test Users 

Included with install

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
|user{1-9} |pass{1-9} |
|admin1    |pass1     |
